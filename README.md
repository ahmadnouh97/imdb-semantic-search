## Introduction

Welcome to **IMDB Semantic Search**! This Streamlit application allows you to perform semantic searches on IMDb movies using a ChromDB (Vector Database). By leveraging semantic search techniques, you can find movies based on their meaning rather than just keywords.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/imdb-semantic-search.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd imdb-semantic-search
```

3. Initialize your environment using Poetry:

```bash
poetry init
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

5. Activate environment by running:
    ```bash
    source .venv/Scripts/activate # For windows
    ``` 
    or
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate # For Linux & Mac
    ```

6. Index data by running:
    ```bash
    python index.py
    ```

7. Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run 1_üè†_Home.py
```


## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: This application is built using Streamlit, a powerful framework for creating data-centric web applications with simple Python scripts.

- **ChromDB (Vector Database)**: The semantic search functionality is powered by ChromDB, a vector database that enables efficient storage and retrieval of vectorized data. ChromDB utilizes Sentence Transformer, specifically the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, to calculate the embeddings of the data.

- **Sentence Transformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)**: This model is employed within ChromDB to convert textual data into numerical vectors, facilitating semantic similarity calculations. It plays a crucial role in enabling effective semantic search capabilities within the application.

- **IMDb Dataset**: The application utilizes [IMDb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashpalsingh1525/imdb-movies-dataset?resource=download) for movie information including names, genre, date, crew, and others.
